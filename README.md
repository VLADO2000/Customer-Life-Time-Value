# Customer-Life-Time-Value
pandas, Matplotlib, seaborn, lumpy
Hi there, 
In this code you will find same solilution that google search could give you< but there i have done all work in one file.
In result I discovered life time value of 6th month per one customer equal 36$
Additionaly we had seen that avarage customer makes 2 transactions every 18 days and spends 8,5$ in that period.
